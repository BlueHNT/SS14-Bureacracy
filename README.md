# SS14-Bureaucracy

**repo made for the suffering of crew members and bureaucracy of command and central.**

**Info**
The reason for the documents always starting with `# Name` is due to the printers auto-labeling documents printed with it. So it comes pre-labeled with the said name, like for example `printed paper(Priority Shipment Request)` and so on.
