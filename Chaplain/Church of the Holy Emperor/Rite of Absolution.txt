[head=2]Rite of Absolution[/head]  

[italic]"O wandering soul, adrift in the tides of sin,  
Know that repentance grants you His mercy.  
By the Emperor's light, your burdens are lifted,  
By His will, your path is cleansed.  

Let your misdeeds burn in holy fire.  
Let your doubts be purged by sacred flame.  
For His judgment is final, and His grace eternal.  

Speak now your guilt, that you may be freed.  
Act now with faith, that you may be redeemed.  
In His name, and His light, you are absolved."[/italic]  

[color=#AAAAAA]This rite must be spoken with sincerity to ensure the absolution of one’s sins before the Emperor’s judgment.[/color]
