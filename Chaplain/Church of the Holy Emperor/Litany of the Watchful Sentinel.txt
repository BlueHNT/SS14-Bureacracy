[head=2]Litany of the Watchful Sentinel[/head]  

[italic]"By my oath, I stand as a bulwark.  
By my word, I uphold the law.  
By my spirit, I shield the innocent.  

Let no heresy breach my resolve.  
Let no darkness cloud my vigilance.  
For I am the bastion against chaos,  
The sword against those who sow destruction.  

My badge is my honor; my weapon, my justice.  
I serve with strength, restraint, and unyielding faith.  
For the station's sanctity, I endure all hardships.  
For my comrades' trust, I offer my life.  

The law is my creed,  
The station my charge,  
And duty my eternal litany."[/italic]  

[color=#AAAAAA]This Litany is a sacred vow to uphold justice and protect the crew, an unbreakable commitment to vigilance and strength.[/color]
