[head=2]Prayer of Protection[/head]  

[italic]"Blessed are the faithful, whose hearts know no fear.  
By the Emperor’s radiance, I walk unshaken.  
May His gaze shield me from the encroaching shadows,  
And His wrath smite those who dare threaten me.  

For the Emperor watches, and I am His servant.  
To doubt is to falter; to waver is to perish.  
In Him, I find strength. In Him, I find victory."[/italic]  

[color=#AAAAAA]This prayer, sanctified by His light, is a call for divine protection. Speak it with unwavering conviction to invoke the Emperor’s shield.[/color]
