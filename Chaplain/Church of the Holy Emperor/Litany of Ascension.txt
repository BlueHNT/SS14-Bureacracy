[head=2]Litany of Ascension[/head]  

[italic]"O seeker of the abyss, bearer of unyielding will,  
Within the frail shell of flesh, awaken the storm.  

By the mind's clarity, pierce the veil.  
By the pulse of defiance, grasp the forbidden truths.  
For power calls to the steadfast,  
And the Immaterium’s fire ignites the worthy soul.  

I bind thee, spirit indomitable, to the raging tempest.  
I shield thee, mind unbroken, from the horrors unseen.  
With whispers of void and light of defiance,  
Let the ascendant path carve thy destiny.  

Remember this:  
Power is the servant of the resolute,  
But it consumes the reckless.  
Stand firm, for the tides will test thee.  
Stand resolute, for your will is your salvation.  

By this rite, I summon the unseen forth.  
By this litany, I claim the mantle of ascension.  

May the storm be caged within me,  
And its might become my weapon."[/italic]  

[color=#AAAAAA]Reciting this Litany demands both resolve and wisdom. Only those of unbreakable spirit can endure the awakening it invokes; others will fall to ruin.[/color]
