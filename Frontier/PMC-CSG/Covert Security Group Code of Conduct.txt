[head=2]Covert Security Group - Code of Conduct[/head]

[bold]Follow the Commander’s Orders[/bold]:
PMC Commander’s word is final unless overridden by a unanimous crew vote in extreme circumstances.

[bold]No Backstabbing[/bold]:
Crew loyalty is mandatory. Betrayal of CSG interests, crew members, or contracts will not be tolerated.

[bold]Fight Smart, Fight to Win[/bold]:
Use force only when necessary to achieve the mission. Don’t pick fights you can’t win, but don’t cower from a challenge.

[bold]Share the Spoils[/bold]:
All earnings, including contraband profits, are distributed fairly based on contribution.

[bold]Respect the Crew[/bold]:
No unnecessary harm to fellow team members or their property. Settling disputes via challenges is acceptable with the Commander’s approval.

[bold]Keep it Quiet[/bold]:
Keep CSG operations, smuggling locations, and client information confidential. Leaks will be dealt with severely.

[bold]Stay Ready[/bold]:
Keep your gear maintained, your skills sharp, and yourself battle-ready. If you aren’t prepared, you’re a liability.

[color=#AAAAAA]Breaking the code of conduct will result in docking of pay, time in brig, expulsion or handover to authorities, if found to be within extreme breach of Code of Conduct.[/color]
